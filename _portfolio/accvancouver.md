This project is a work in progress...

I am currently leading an initiative to develop a new web application, data pipeline, and design for a Wordpress site where members of the [Alpine Club of Canada - Vancouver Section](http://www.accvancouver.org/) (ACC - Vancouver) can plan, post, and sign up for trips and events.
The existing ACC - Vancouver calendar system is running on antiquated technology, is difficult to use, and impossible to maintain (there is no access to the code base).

So far I have designed and developed a new wordpress site, integrated and customized an existing calendar tool plugin, integrated custom .php plugins to hande secure member data profiles. I am now designing and conducting user testing to validate and iteratively improve this work.
