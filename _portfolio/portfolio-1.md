I currently work as a web designer, developer, data visualization designer, and data base manager for [Mana Financial Life Design](https://www.manafld.com). 

Mana FLD is revolutionizing the world of financial advice (read more [here](https://www.manafld.com/philosophy/). My job is to support this endeavor using both my techincal skills, as well as my research background in behavioral Psychology. 

Unfortunately, I cannot share the details of most of my visualization work for Mana FLD (personal finance data is sensitive!), but I am always happy to chat about this work at a high level. The world of personal finance is full of fascinating and challenging problems for researchers interested in decision making, vision, visualization, design, and behavioral economics.
