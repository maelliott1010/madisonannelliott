I currently work as a web designer, developer, data visualization designer, and data base manager for [Mana Financial Life Design](https://www.manafld.com). 

Mana FLD is revolutionizing the world of financial advice (read more [here](https://www.manafld.com/philosophy/)). My job is to support this endeavor using both my techincal skills, as well as my research background in behavioral Psychology. 

Unfortunately, I cannot share the details of most of my visualization work for Mana FLD (personal finance data is sensitive!), but I am always happy to chat about high level aspects of this work. The world of personal finance is full of fascinating and challenging problems for researchers interested in decision making, human vision, visualization, design, and behavioral economics.
