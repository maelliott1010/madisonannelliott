Evaluative practices within vis research are not routinely compared to those of psychology, sociology, or other areas of empirical study,
leaving vis vulnerable to the replicability crisis that has embroiled scientific research more generally. In this position paper, we compare contemporary vis evaluative practices against those in those other disciplines, and make concrete recommendations as to how vis
evaluative practice can be improved through the use of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods. We summarize our discussion and recommendations as a checklist, that we intend to be used a resource for vis researchers conducting evaluative studies, and for
reviewers evaluating the merits of such studies.
