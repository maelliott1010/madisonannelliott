I am a co-founder of the research group [VisXVision](https://visxvision.com)! We are a like-minded research community, situated at the intersection of information visualization and vision science psychology.

Vision science provides an empirical basis for techniques and design practices in visualization, including what data features people attend to, what statistics they extract, and what they ultimately remember. Visualization provides real world problems for vision scientists to investigate, including color perception, pop-out, and salience. Help us explore and promote this promising research partnership!

VisXVision is a place for sharing the latest relevant publications, conference events, and collaborative efforts between these two communities.

If you are also interested in this kind of work, please check out our website! Joining our group gives you access to our Slack channel, the latest news, and the various presentation / collaboration opportunities facilitated by our group.
