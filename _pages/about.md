I am currently in my third year of a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I study the limits of visual attentional selection under the supervision of Dr. Ron Rensink. Most of my experiments investigate how we use attention to perceieve information in data visualizations. I am interested in both applied and basic science issues, like how we select one population of data over another in a multiclass scatterplot, or we use features like color in situations that require complex attention. I am also a member of Dr. Tamara Munzner's InfoVis research group at UBC. There, I have been investigating the utility of Low Stretch Spanning Trees (a cool, fairly recent discovery from the math world) for the quasi-tree edge bundling and layout. These techniques can be used to declutter dense "hairball" graph visualizations.

I also have over 5 years of professional experience working as a usability engineer and data visualization consultant. I have designed, user-tested, and improved software and websites for companies in both the US and Canada, including Northrop Grumman, Social Security Administration, Mana Financial Life Design, UBC Digital Literacy, the Alpine Club of Canada, INETCO, Distrix Ltd., and more...
