This is my personal website...

Yes, it is ugly. But it's all built and maintained with simple Markdown and HTML, and it's hosted for free on GitHub pages :)

**About me**

I am currently in my third year of a Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I study the limits of visual attentional selection under the supervision of Dr. Ron Rensink at the [UBC Visual Cognition Lab](https://viscoglab.psych.ubc.ca/). Most of my experiments investigate how we use attention to perceieve information in data visualizations. I am interested in both applied and basic science issues, like how we select one population of data over another in a multiclass scatterplot, or we use features like color in situations that require complex attention. I am also a member of [Dr. Tamara Munzner](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/)'s [InfoVis research group](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/group/infovis/) at UBC. There, I have been investigating the utility of Low Stretch Spanning Trees (a cool, fairly recent discovery from the math world) for quasi-tree edge bundling and layout. These algorithmic techniques can be used to declutter dense "hairball" graph visualizations.

I also have over 5 years of professional experience working as a usability engineer and data visualization consultant. I have designed, user-tested, and improved software and websites for companies in both the US and Canada, including Northrop Grumman, Social Security Administration, Mana Financial Life Design, UBC Digital Literacy, the Alpine Club of Canada, INETCO, Distrix Ltd., and more...
