**Overview** <br/>
This is a course designed to teach students how to think analytically, in science and beyond. I use a combination of traditional lecturing, written assessments, group anaylsis, oral debates, socratic seminars, exams, and a critique of published research, to evaluate students and facilitate intellecutal growth. I have been teaching COGS 303 for 4 years.

We are constantly evolving our use of technology for this course. We've successfully used Google forms, online quiz tools, Canvas, media presentations, and interactive Google docs so far!

*We have been evolving our course for virtual learning during COVID, using Zoom and Canvas to facilitate group work.
