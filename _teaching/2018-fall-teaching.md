**Overview:**
This course introduces students to psychological science. The focus is on social, developmental, and health aspects of psychology. The  ultimate goal for students is to develop the skills necessary to be critical consumers of psychological science.

Because I am passionate about usability and good user experience, I did not want to use an old-fashioned static syllabus for this course (who reads those anyway?). Check out my replacement, an online interactive syllabus, [here](http://blogs.ubc.ca/psyc102egp/)! I am especially proud of the "Feeling Stressed?" page on this website, as I believe students should have clear access to these types of resources.
